The cutest and uwu-est theme for [Dofus]. 

This will be maintained until Dofus Unity's release (roughly end of 2024). Big sad face :( If Unity ever allows themes again, which unfortunately should not be the case, I'll try making something else over there uwu

## Install

Open **Options** > **Themes**, then enter the following URL:

```

```

All instructions can be found at [softUwu].
To install the Dark Tactic Mode, you must first install the theme but it won't show up in Dofus. After you clicked on "Install" once, restart your game and the tactic mode should be there. *(You might also need to uncheck colored tactic mode in Dofus' options)*
